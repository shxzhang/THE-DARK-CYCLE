WHAT IS THE DARK CYCLE?

THE DARK CYCLE is an educational boardgame I have created after failing to implement my student's suggestion to make a DnD miniquest that's based on a biochemical pathway. (If you think you know how to do this, please email me.) It can be played at either the simple or advanced level. Simple level covers main photosynthesis material that would be found at an introductory level biology class at a 4-year university. Advanced level is more difficult to play (i.e. to win) and includes concepts about stress factors and their effects on photosynthesis as well as what reversible reaction can mean during photosynthesis.

THIS IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF ALL CALVIN-BENSON CYCLE MATERIAL. Even not including new discoveries made yearly by biologists, for the simplicity of making this game playable and accessible to a lower-division biology class, there is significant simplification of several parts of the Calvin-Benson Cycle. This game is meant to reinforce key concepts, as a supplement to lecture material, and is NOT meant to be substitude for lecture. 

THIS GAME IS FREE TO PLAY, FREE TO SHARE, AND FREE TO CHANGE. I'm releasing everything under a Creative Commons attribution noncommercial sharealike license (i.e. you can use, change, do whatever you want to it so long as you don't sell it for money and you give proper credit (i.e. cite me)). You should be able to just print the images, cut a few things with scissors, and then play. There is meant to be minimal cost.

ACCESSIBILITY: I have checked the design for friendliness to folks with color-blindness and would appreciate feedback from people who may have other accessibility issues. 

This game is last updated Nov. 18, 2022, version 1.
